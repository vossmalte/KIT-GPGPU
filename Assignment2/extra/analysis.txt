Comparison:
As the graphic shows, Atomics out-perform all other approaches by a minimum speedup of 20%
Different LocalWorkSize do not seem to affect Atomics to much.
It performed best with a work-group size of 256.

Personally, I was surprised that loop-unrolling made such a difference.

Check out how kernelDecompositionUnroll and kernelDecompositionAtomics perform on a similar level.
But the atomic code is so much easier to maintain.
